All of this information is given in the `date` column of the `ins` dataframe.\n","\n","**Part 1:** What is the type of the individual `ins['date']` entries? You may want to grab the very first entry and use the `type` function in python.\n","\n","**Part 2:** Rather than the type you discovered in Part 1, we want each entry in `pd.TimeStamp` format. You might expect that the usual way to convert something from it current type to `TimeStamp` would be to use `astype`. You can do that, but the more typical way is to use `pd.to_datetime`. Using `pd.to_datetime`, create a new `ins['timestamp']` column containing `pd.Timestamp` objects.  These will allow us to do date manipulation with much greater ease in part 3 and part 4\n","\n","**Part 3:** What are the earliest and latest dates in our inspection data?  *Hint: you can use `min` and `max` on dates of the correct type.*\n","\n","**Part 4:** We probably want to examine the inspections by year. Create an additional `ins['year']` column containing just the year of the inspection.  Consider using `pd.Series.dt.year` to do this.\n","\n","In case you're curious, the documentation for `TimeStamp` data can be found at [this link](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.Timestamp.html#pandas.Timestamp).\n","\n","**No python `for` loops or list comprehensions are allowed!**"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"sWCSWuVXEgA_"},"source":["**Part 1**\n","\n","<!--\n","BEGIN QUESTION\n","name: q3ci\n","points: 1\n","-->"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":13,"status":"ok","timestamp":1673483402230,"user":{"displayName":"Brian B","userId":"12495060759334530704"},"user_tz":480},"id":"SdXeE3LiEgA_","outputId":"375de1ee-5755-4753-9aec-20c6e2505d04"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["str"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":55}],"source":["ins_date_type = type(ins['date'][0])\n","ins_date_type"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":10,"status":"ok","timestamp":1673483402230,"user":{"displayName":"Brian B","userId":"12495060759334530704"},"user_tz":480},"id":"QCMIT8HKPcoS","outputId":"deb2bd51-e2a0-41d3-8816-b02d0ca85277"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["iid      object\n","date     object\n","score     int64\n","type     object\n","bid       int64\n","dtype: object"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":56}],"source":["ins.dtypes"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"a7PvJIj3EgA_"},"source":["**Part 2**\n","\n","<!--\n","BEGIN QUESTION\n","name: q3cii\n","points: 1\n","-->"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":424},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":632,"status":"ok","timestamp":1673483402855,"user":{"displayName":"Brian B","userId":"12495060759334530704"},"user_tz":480},"id":"-M3p5lW_EgBA","outputId":"624aafa6-bbe1-47db-f5ff-0bcca1c8b4f8"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                   iid                    date  score                   type  \\\n","0      100010_20190329  03/29/2019 12:00:00 AM     -1       New Construction   \n","1      100010_20190403  04/03/2019 12:00:00 AM    100  Routine -
