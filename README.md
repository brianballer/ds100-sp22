## Data 100 Spring 2022

Fork of UC Berkeley's Data 100 class from spring 2022. The material is very similar to my Purdue master's data science courses, but we used R vice Python. My current team uses Python exclusively.  Thus, in the spirit of teamwork, I'm auditing this Python data science class to develop in the team's majority language.
